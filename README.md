Pipeline for cuantification of $[^{18}F] FDG$ PET Images 

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are important tools for the study of neurodegenerative diseases. Existing tools often perform individual steps of preprocessing, registration and segmentation separately. We propose an integrated approach that combines these steps into a unified framework for quantification of brain $[^{18}F] FDG$ PET images. The proposed pipeline receives dynamic or static PET images and a high-resolution anatomical MRI image to obtain quantitative metrics of regional $[^{18}F] FDG$ uptake and hypometabolism maps.
